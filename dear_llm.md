# Dear LLM - Ookkee Development Journal

This file documents the key decisions and steps taken during the development of Ookkee, the AI bookkeeping assistant.

## Project Overview

**Name**: Ookkee (from "bookkeeper" - the only English word with three consecutive double letters)
**Purpose**: AI bookkeeping assistant with human-in-the-loop workflow
**Architecture**: React + Vite frontend, Go + Chi backend, PostgreSQL database

## Development Journey

### Phase 1: Initial Boilerplate (Commits: Initial â†’ 334b8a6)

**Goal**: Create basic file upload functionality

**Steps Taken**:
1. Created project structure with `frontend/`, `backend/`, `uploads/` directories
2. Set up React + Vite frontend with file upload component
3. Built Go + Chi backend with multipart file handling
4. Implemented drag-and-drop CSV upload with validation
5. Added progress tracking and user feedback

**Key Files Created**:
- `frontend/src/components/FileUpload.jsx` - Drag-and-drop upload interface
- `backend/main.go` - HTTP server with file upload endpoint
- `README.md` - Initial documentation

**Technologies Used**:
- Frontend: React 18, Vite, custom CSS
- Backend: Go, Chi router, CORS middleware
- File Storage: Local filesystem with timestamp naming

### Phase 2: Database Integration & UI Overhaul (Commits: 334b8a6 â†’ 7199026)

**Goal**: Transform into full-featured spreadsheet interface with PostgreSQL backend

**Major Changes**:
1. **Database Layer**:
   - Switched from `lib/pq` to `pgx/v5` (modern PostgreSQL driver)
   - Implemented comprehensive schema with migrations
   - Added proper transaction handling

2. **Schema Design**:
   ```sql
   - project: Metadata for each uploaded CSV
   - expense: Individual rows from CSV files (JSONB for flexibility)
   - expense_category: Categories for AI classification
   - expense_history: Audit trail for AI suggestions
   ```

3. **UI Transformation**:
   - Left sidebar navigation for projects
   - Google Sheets-like spreadsheet interface
   - Infinite scrolling for large datasets (50 rows/page)
   - Color-coded financial data (red/green for expenses/income)
   - Currency formatting and date parsing

4. **API Endpoints**:
   - `GET /api/projects` - List all projects
   - `GET /api/projects/{id}/expenses` - Paginated expense data
   - `POST /api/upload` - Enhanced to create projects and import CSV rows
   - `GET /api/health` - Service health check

**Key Files Created**:
- `frontend/src/components/ProjectsSidebar.jsx` - Project navigation
- `frontend/src/components/SpreadsheetView.jsx` - Google Sheets-like table
- `db/migrations/V1__Initial_schema.sql` - Database schema
- Updated `backend/main.go` - Full database integration

**Technical Decisions**:
- Used JSONB for raw CSV data (flexible schema)
- Implemented proper pagination for performance
- Color-coded UI for better UX (expenses red, income green)
- Automatic migrations on backend startup

### Phase 3: Production Readiness (Commits: 7199026 â†’ 57a4a8e)

**Goal**: Add comprehensive testing, Docker deployment, and production setup

**Additions**:
1. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Go unit tests for API endpoints
   - React component tests with Vitest
   - Integration tests for full workflow
   - Test coverage reporting

2. **Docker Deployment**:
   - Multi-stage Docker builds for frontend/backend
   - Docker Compose orchestration with PostgreSQL
   - Proper health checks and dependencies
   - Volume management for data persistence

3. **Development Tools**:
   - Makefile with common commands
   - Migration scripts
   - Integration test suite
   - Comprehensive documentation

**Key Files Created**:
- `backend/main_test.go` - Go unit tests
- `frontend/src/components/__tests__/FileUpload.test.jsx` - React tests
- `docker-compose.yml` - Full stack orchestration
- `Makefile` - Development commands
- `test/integration_test.sh` - End-to-end testing

### Phase 4: Environment Management & Enhanced UX (Commits: 57a4a8e â†’ 4a6b295)

**Goal**: Add professional project management UI and environment configuration

**Major Additions**:
1. **Environment Configuration System**:
   - `env.sh` script for loading different environments
   - `config/` directory with `.envrc.*` files for dev/docker/prod
   - Makefile integration with `make dev-setup`
   - Backend support for environment variables (DB_HOST, SERVER_PORT, etc.)

2. **Enhanced Project Management UI**:
   - Modal-based project creation/editing with custom names
   - "â‹®" hover menu on projects with Edit/Delete options
   - Better visual hierarchy (project names prominent, filenames in gray)
   - Improved placeholders and empty states
   - Keyboard shortcuts (Escape) and click-outside-to-close

3. **New API Endpoints**:
   - `PUT /api/projects/{id}` - Update project name
   - `DELETE /api/projects/{id}` - Soft delete projects
   - Enhanced upload endpoint accepts custom project names

**Key Files Created**:
- `env.sh` - Environment loading script
- `config/.envrc.{example,development,docker}` - Environment configurations
- `frontend/src/components/ProjectModal.jsx` - Modal for project create/edit
- `frontend/src/components/ProjectMenu.jsx` - Dropdown menu for project actions

**UX Improvements**:
- Replaced simple upload button with professional "+" button
- Added project name field in upload workflow  
- Left-aligned project names with right-aligned action menu
- Proper modal focus management and accessibility
- Soft delete preserves data while hiding from UI

## Architecture Decisions

### Why PostgreSQL + pgx?
- Modern, high-performance driver
- Excellent JSONB support for flexible CSV schemas
- Better connection pooling and performance
- Native Go integration without ORM overhead

### Why React + Vite?
- Fast development experience
- Modern build tooling
- Excellent hot reload for UI development
- Lightweight compared to Next.js for this use case

### Why Go + Chi?
- High performance for file processing
- Excellent concurrency for multiple uploads
- Simple, lightweight HTTP router
- Great PostgreSQL ecosystem

### Why Infinite Scrolling?
- Handle large CSV files (2000+ rows) efficiently
- Better UX than traditional pagination
- Reduces memory usage on frontend
- Smooth scrolling experience

## Current Capabilities

## Known Issues Fixed

1. **Migration Conflicts**: Removed duplicate Docker init migrations
2. **Docker Compose**: Updated commands for macOS compatibility
3. **Frontend Build**: Fixed Vite dependency issues in Docker
4. **Go Version**: Updated to 1.24.3 for compatibility

## Future Roadmap

ðŸ”® **Planned Features**:

## Development Environment

**Setup**:
```bash
# First-time setup
make dev-setup
source ./env.sh development

# Start all services
make up

# Run tests
make test

# View logs
make logs
```

**Environment Management**:
```bash
# Load environment and run commands
source ./env.sh development && go run backend/main.go
source ./env.sh docker && docker compose up
source ./env.sh production && docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up

# Or use make commands (loads environment automatically)
make up                      # Docker with auto environment loading
make dev-backend            # Local backend development
make dev-frontend           # Local frontend development
```

**Testing**:
```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend && go test -v

# Frontend tests  
cd frontend && npm test

# Integration tests
./test/integration_test.sh
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with proper database design** - The JSONB approach for CSV data was crucial for flexibility
2. **Infinite scrolling is essential** - Large datasets require proper pagination strategy
3. **Docker Compose version matters** - macOS uses `docker compose` not `docker-compose`
4. **Multi-stage builds save space** - Especially important for Node.js applications
5. **Test early and often** - Integration tests caught several deployment issues

## Performance Considerations

- **Database**: Proper indexes on project_id and pagination
- **Frontend**: Virtual scrolling for very large datasets
- **Backend**: Connection pooling and prepared statements
- **Docker**: Multi-stage builds for smaller production images
